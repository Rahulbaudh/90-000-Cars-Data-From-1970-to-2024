# Exploring Car Prices: A Machine Learning Project

Hey everyone,

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I've delved into the fascinating world of car data spanning from 1970 to 2024. With over 90,000 cars in the dataset, I've utilized various machine learning techniques to analyze, visualize, and predict car prices.

# Project Overview:

In this project, I've undertaken a comprehensive analysis of car data, focusing on factors influencing car prices over the years. The project involves several key components:

Data Analysis: I've conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of car features, identify correlations, and gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

Data Visualization: Leveraging powerful visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I've created insightful plots and charts to illustrate trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

Feature Engineering: To enhance the predictive power of the model, I've engineered relevant features, handled missing values, and transformed categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Employing four different regression algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor - I've built models to predict car prices based on various features.

# Key Features of the Project:

Comprehensive Dataset: With over 90,000 cars spanning several decades, the dataset provides a rich source of information for analysis and modeling.

Predictive Modeling: By implementing multiple regression algorithms, I've created models capable of accurately predicting car prices based on specified features.

Interactive Visualizations: Through interactive plots and charts, users can explore the relationships between different features and understand their impact on car prices.
